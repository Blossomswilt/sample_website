    <h1>The Learn Enough Story </h1>

    <p>
      Learn Enuogh to Be Danegrous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command fo your ocmputer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everythnig form command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to juts reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
      benefit from learning technical sophistication, probbaly more. To join our
